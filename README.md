# Miscellaneous scripts

Scripts I wrote for pleasure and utility.

## pasteget.py

A script to download the top 20 pastes from the last 48 hours from pastebin.com. Using it is a bit like putting an iPod on shuffle: you never know what you might get, whether it's dox on the execs of a Fortune 500 company, jokes, code, or a mad cracker's manifesto. It's interesting regardless.

## License

See LICENSE. I won't enforce any of the terms, though :) Basically, do whatever you want, and if you're feeling nice, give me some credit.
