# Miscellaneous scripts

Scripts I wrote for pleasure and utility.

## [pasteget.py](https://github.com/RafeKettler/misc-scripts/blob/master/pasteget.py)

A script to download the top 20 pastes from the last 48 hours from [pastebin.com](http://www.pastebin.com). Using it is a bit like putting an iPod on shuffle: you never know what you might get, whether it's dox on the execs of a Fortune 500 company, jokes, code, or a mad cracker's manifesto. It's interesting regardless.

## [request_test.py](https://github.com/RafeKettler/misc-scripts/blob/master/request_test.py)

Reports on response times for a couple of different CDNs that Stack Overflow was testing out. See [the related SO blog post](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/05/the-speed-of-light-sucks/).
